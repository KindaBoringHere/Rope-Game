I couldnt turn the game into an executable so i had to write this

follow these steps to run the game properly:

1) Download and install pygame:
    
    On Windows:
        1) Press WinKey + R to open the run prompt.

        2) Enter "cmd" and press enter.

        3) Enter and run the following command in the opened window: "pip install pygame"

        4) After it is finished, simply run the file "main.py".


Hope you enjoy it!
